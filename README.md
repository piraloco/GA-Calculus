# GA-Calculus
My research notes on doing Calculus purely algebraically using Geometric Algebra.

## Introduction
Vector calculus presents students with a
massive amount of operations: gradients,
partial derivatives, divergence, curl,
directional derivatives, and their generalizations
to differential forms. Each comes with its own notation,
geometric interpretation, and computational rules.
This document provides an alternative that unifies all of these.
